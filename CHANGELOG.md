## Notes on versioning and releases

- We use **SemVer**:
  - **MAJOR** – breaking changes to artifact structure or validation semantics
  - **MINOR** – backward-compatible additions to schema or validation rules
  - **PATCH** – fixes, documentation, tooling
- Versions are driven by git tags. Tag `vX.Y.Z` to release.
- Docs are deployed per version tag and aliased to **latest**.
- Sample commands:

```shell
# as needed
git tag -d v0.1.0
git push origin :refs/tags/v0.1.0

# new tag / release
git tag v0.1.0 -m "0.1.0"
git push origin v0.1.0
```
